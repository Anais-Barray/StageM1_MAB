Anais Barray's github repository. You can access the scripts and datasets I use during my computer science Master formation.
- In the software file you will find phylogenetic placement softwares or the ones needed to make a metagenomic study using phylogenetic placement methods.
- In the software file, you will also find a script file where you can get the galaxy scripts (xml and wrappers) for a use of the phylogenetic placement tools on the galaxy platform.
- You can test all the tools and scripts with the simulated datasets you will find in the dataset file.

Greets!
