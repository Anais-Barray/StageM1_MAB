Anais Barray's Bioinformatics Master 1 internship github repository. You can access the scripts and datasets I used for the studies I conducted.

- In the software file you will find phylogenetic placement softwares or the ones needed to make a metagenomic study using phylogenetic placement methods.
- The script file (found in the software file) contains :
    * the Galaxy scripts (xml and wrappers) for a use of the phylogenetic placement tools on the galaxy platform (tools        that you should install properly beforehand).
    * the scripts to make restricted trees and Robinson Foulds comparisons
- You can test all the tools and scripts with the simulated datasets you will find in the dataset file.

Greets!
