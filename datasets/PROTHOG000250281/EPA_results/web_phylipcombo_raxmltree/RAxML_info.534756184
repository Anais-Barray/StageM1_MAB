RAxML placement algorithm: You provided a reference tree with 34 taxa; alignmnet has 35 taxa
1 query taxa will be placed using maximum likelihood

RAxML Evolutionary Placement Algorithm

Likelihood of reference tree: -11068.511637

RAxML will place 1 Query Sequences into the 65 branches of the reference tree with 34 taxa

Overall Classification time: 5.623901
